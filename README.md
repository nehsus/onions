# Opinions
## _For Everyone!_

Opinions shows you the happiness/satisfaction index on scale of 1 - 10 for top 500 US universities based on their professors' rating. 
In addition to the universities, you can also find the individual professor rating for any of those universities.

Python with MongoDB for database and React for frontend

## Features
- Select a university from the dropdown
- See its happiness/satisfaction index
- Select a professor from that university
- See his/her rating
- Make your decision

## Tech

Opinions uses many open source technologies to show you what you asked for:

- [ReactJS 18.0.0] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Python 3.9.12] - makes the magic happen
- [mongoDB Atlas] - NoSQL db to make our lives easier

And of course Opinions itself is open source for future research.
